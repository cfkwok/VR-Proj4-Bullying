          <p class="lead">
          
      Bullying affects hundreds of thousands students' lives throughout their personal and academic careers. 
      There are various forms of bullying but we decided to protray some physical and verbal examples.
      People choose to bully others for different reasons but in our experience, the victim is bullied 
      for his sexual orientation and appearance. We chose to include this in our experience because of the 
      statistics we found regarding the high percentages of the students that were bullied for their sexual 
      orientation. When presented with a bullying situation, your actions and decisions as a bystander 
      or the victim can have a direct impact on the outcome. Making the right choices can lead to the 
      correct consequences for the bully and more positive results for the victim.
